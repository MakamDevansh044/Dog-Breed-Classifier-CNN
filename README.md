# Dog Breed Classifier

This project is a machine learning application designed to classify images of dogs into their respective breeds. The model is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and is implemented in Python with the use of Google Colab.

## Features

- Image Classification: Identifies and classifies dog breeds from images.
- Convolutional Neural Network: Utilizes deep learning for accurate predictions.
- Preprocessing: Includes image preprocessing techniques for better model performance.
- Evaluation: Provides metrics to evaluate the model's performance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MakamDevansh044/Dog-Breed-Classifier-CNN
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DogBreedClassifier-CNN
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open the `Dog Breed Classifier.ipynb` file:
   - Navigate through the notebook cells and execute them sequentially to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.

## Files

- `Dog Breed Classifier.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the code for preprocessing, training, and evaluating the model.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required for the project.
